    This abstract base class specifies the interface to which all top-level applet operators must adhere.
    The distinguishing characteristic of a top-level operator is the fact that they must be capable of 
    supporting multiple images via multi-slots that are indexed by image lane number.
    
    Image lanes of the top-level operator are added, removed, and accessed via the ``addLane``, ``removeLane``, and ``getLane`` functions.
    
    .. note:: Most applets can simply inherit from the :py:class:`StandardApplet <ilastik.applets.base.standardApplet.StandardApplet>` base class, 
              which will automatically adapt single-lane top-level operators to satisfy this interface.
